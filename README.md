Java Lexical Analyzer

Lexical analyzer that gets a txt file as an input and finds all the sentences it contains as well as all the words per sentence .

You can read LexicalAnalyzerGreekDocumentation.pdf for more information about the project .(it's in greek)

Mini note : *I probably should have used stringbuilder instead of string in many cases*

Thank you !
